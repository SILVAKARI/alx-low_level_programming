TASK 5:

Island Perimeter mandatory Technical interview preparation:
You are not allowed to google anything Whiteboard first Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

grid is a list of list of integers: 0 represents a water zone 1 represents a land zone One cell is a square with side length 1 Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100 Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing). The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island). Requirements:

First line contains #!/usr/bin/python3 You are not allowed to import any module Module and function must be documented guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x1C$ cat 5-main.py #!/usr/bin/python3 """ 5-main """ island_perimeter = import('5-island_perimeter').island_perimeter

if name == "main": grid = [ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ] print(island_perimeter(grid))

Since Makefiles are like recipes, then Happy Cooking!
